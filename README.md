A utility for setting all new windows to a dark theme in Windows 11.

This only works for windows using the default theme. 
Therefore, the program will be compatible with, for example, Steam or Telegram windows.

After compilation, you can add this utility to startup. 
However, for applications with administrator rights, you'll need to duplicate the startup sequence using, for example, taskschd.msc.
