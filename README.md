A utility that forces all newly created windows in Windows 11 to use the dark theme.

It works only with windows that use the default system theme.
As a result, the program is compatible with applications such as Steam and Telegram.

After building the project, the utility can be added to startup.
However, for applications running with administrative privileges, the startup process must be duplicated—for example, by using **Task Scheduler** (`taskschd.msc`).
